# Palworld-FModel

Mapping files for use with [FModel](https://github.com/4sval/FModel). Set the Mapping [Endpoint Configuration](https://github.com/4sval/FModel/wiki/Settings-Explanation#endpoint-configuration) to have _Endpoint_: `https://drayx.github.io/Palworld-FModel/mappings/` and _Expression_: `$['<version>']['Url', 'FileName']` where `<version>` is the version of Palworld (for example, `$['0.3.1.55394']['Url', 'FileName']`). Note that some early versions of Palworld use the same version number for multiple patches; these are differentiated by an `_1` and `_2` suffix. The mapping file URLs use the Steam manifest ID as the containing directory (see [SteamDB](https://steamdb.info/depot/1623731/manifests/)), which may help matching these versions.
